## Problem 17 of Project Euler [link](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)

I thought about building a mapper myself, but in the interests of time (we had set only five minutes for the problem, though it took nearly fifteen!), I looked for a gem instead. I found the perfect one in [Numbers and Words](https://github.com/kslazarev/numbers_and_words). However, my first solution was incorrect. I realized I had skipped the 'hundred_with_unions' language option, so I was shy a couple of hundred "the's". With that additon, it was an easy solution.
